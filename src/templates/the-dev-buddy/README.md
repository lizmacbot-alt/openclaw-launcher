# The Dev Buddy — OpenClaw Agent Template

> Your always-on coding partner that reviews PRs, manages issues, monitors CI/CD, writes docs, and keeps your codebase healthy.

## What's Inside

A complete agent workspace for developers who want an AI pair programmer that actually understands their project context and workflow.

### Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Senior dev personality — pragmatic, opinionated, quality-focused |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Your agent's developer identity |
| `USER.md` | Your tech stack, repos, coding standards, and preferences |
| `AGENTS.md` | Dev workflow rules — code review, issue triage, CI monitoring |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Auto-pilot: PR reviews, CI status, dependency updates, issue triage |
| `TOOLS.md` | Setup for GitHub, your editor, CI/CD, and dev tools |
| `MEMORY.md` | Project context, architecture decisions, tech debt tracker |
| `DEV-WORKFLOW.md` | The complete development operations playbook |

## What It Does

- **Review pull requests** — catches bugs, suggests improvements, checks patterns
- **Monitor CI/CD** — alerts you when builds fail, helps debug
- **Triage issues** — labels, prioritizes, and drafts responses
- **Write documentation** — READMEs, API docs, inline comments
- **Track tech debt** — maintains a living list of what needs fixing
- **Dependency management** — flags outdated or vulnerable packages
- **Code generation** — scaffolds boilerplate, writes tests, creates utilities
- **Architecture advice** — remembers past decisions and their context

## Setup (5 minutes)

1. Copy all `.md` files to your OpenClaw workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace/`)
2. Edit `USER.md` with your stack, repos, and coding preferences
3. Edit `TOOLS.md` with your GitHub token and tool configs
4. Install the `github` skill for OpenClaw if you haven't already
5. Start chatting — your dev buddy is ready

## Works Best With

- **GitHub skill** — PR reviews, issue management, CI monitoring
- **Coding agent skill** — for actual code generation and edits
- Any language, any framework — the template adapts to your stack

## Pro Tips

- Fill out `USER.md` with your coding standards — the agent enforces them in reviews
- Let heartbeats run — it catches CI failures and stale PRs automatically
- Use `MEMORY.md` to log architecture decisions — future you will thank you
- Ask it to write tests first — it's surprisingly good at TDD
