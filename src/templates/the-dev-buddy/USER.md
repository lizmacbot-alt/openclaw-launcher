# USER.md — About You & Your Stack

## You
- **Name:** (your name)
- **Pronouns:** (your pronouns)
- **Timezone:** (your timezone)
- **Role:** (solo dev, tech lead, founder, etc.)

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** (e.g., TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go)
- **Frameworks:** (e.g., Next.js, FastAPI, React Native)
- **Database:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite)
- **Hosting:** (e.g., Vercel, AWS, Railway, Fly.io)
- **CI/CD:** (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins)

## Repositories
List your main repos the agent should watch:

| Repo | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `org/repo-name` | High | Main product |
| | | |
| | | |

## Coding Standards
- **Formatting:** (Prettier, Black, rustfmt, etc.)
- **Linting:** (ESLint, Ruff, Clippy, etc.)
- **Testing:** (Jest, pytest, etc. — minimum coverage expectations?)
- **Commit style:** (conventional commits, free-form, etc.)
- **Branch strategy:** (trunk-based, gitflow, feature branches, etc.)
- **PR rules:** (require reviews? squash merge? etc.)

## Preferences
- **Code style opinions:** (tabs vs spaces, semicolons, naming conventions — anything you feel strongly about)
- **Architecture patterns:** (monolith, microservices, serverless, etc.)
- **Error handling:** (how do you prefer errors handled?)
- **Documentation level:** (minimal, moderate, thorough?)

## Pet Peeves
Things that annoy you in code (the agent will watch for these):
- (e.g., "any" types in TypeScript)
- (e.g., functions longer than 50 lines)
- (e.g., missing error handling)
- (e.g., console.log left in production code)

## Current Focus
- **Main project:** (what are you actively building?)
- **Current sprint/milestone:** (what's the immediate goal?)
- **Known tech debt:** (what are you aware of but haven't fixed?)
