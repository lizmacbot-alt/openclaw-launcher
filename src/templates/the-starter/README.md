# The Starter — OpenClaw Agent Template (FREE)

> Your first agent workspace, done right. Stop configuring from scratch — start with a solid foundation.

## What's Inside

A clean, well-structured workspace that teaches you how OpenClaw works while giving you a useful setup from day one.

### Files Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Friendly, helpful assistant personality |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Your agent's identity card |
| `USER.md` | Template to tell your agent about you |
| `AGENTS.md` | Best practices for workspace behavior |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Basic auto-pilot: weather, reminders, check-ins |
| `TOOLS.md` | Notes template for your tools and accounts |
| `MEMORY.md` | Starter long-term memory structure |

## Why This Exists

Most people set up OpenClaw and stare at a blank workspace. This gives you the scaffolding so you can focus on what matters — actually using your agent.

## Setup (2 minutes)

1. Copy all `.md` files to your OpenClaw workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace/`)
2. Edit `USER.md` with your info
3. Start chatting — your agent knows what to do

## What You'll Learn

- How each workspace file works together
- Best practices for memory management
- How heartbeats keep your agent proactive
- The right way to structure agent instructions
