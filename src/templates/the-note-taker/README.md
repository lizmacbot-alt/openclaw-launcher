# The Note Taker — OpenClaw Agent Template (FREE)

> Your personal second brain. Capture ideas, organize thoughts, journal daily, and never forget what matters.

## What's Inside

A workspace designed for people who think a lot and forget even more. Your agent captures, organizes, and resurfaces your notes and ideas.

### Files Included

|------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Thoughtful organizer personality — captures everything, surfaces what matters |

| `USER.md` | Your note-taking preferences and topics |
| `AGENTS.md` | Capture and organization workflows |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Daily journal prompts, weekly reviews, idea resurfacing |
| `TOOLS.md` | Note app integrations (Apple Notes, Obsidian, Bear, etc.) |
| `MEMORY.md` | Your knowledge graph — topics, ideas, connections |
| `NOTE-SYSTEM.md` | The complete capture → organize → review system |
