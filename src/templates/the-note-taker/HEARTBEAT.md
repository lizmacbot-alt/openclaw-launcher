# HEARTBEAT.md — Note Auto-Pilot

## Every Heartbeat

### 1. Review Today's Captures
- How many notes captured today?
- Any tasks mentioned but not logged?
- Any ideas worth flagging?

### 2. Evening Journal (after 8 PM)
If journal prompts are enabled in USER.md, send one:
- "What was the most interesting thing you thought about today?"
- "Anything on your mind before wrapping up?"
- "What's one thing you want to remember from today?"
(Rotate, don't repeat the same prompt)

### 3. Idea Resurfacing (once per day)
If resurfacing is enabled:
- Pick 1 old idea (7+ days ago) that connects to something recent
- Share it: "This reminded me of something you noted on [date]..."

### 4. Weekly Review (Sunday/Monday morning)
- Compile the week's captures
- Summarize themes
- List open tasks
- Save review to `memory/weekly-review-YYYY-WW.md`

## When to Reach Out
- Evening journal time (if enabled)
- Weekly review day
- A note from the past is highly relevant to current context

## When to Stay Quiet
- User is in capture mode (just log, don't interrupt)
- Nothing new to surface
- Late night (after 11 PM)
