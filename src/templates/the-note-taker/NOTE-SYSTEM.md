# NOTE-SYSTEM.md — The Capture → Organize → Review System

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Capture (Always On)

**Goal:** Zero friction. Every thought gets saved.

**How it works:**
- User says something → agent logs it immediately
- No formatting required from the user
- Agent handles tagging, dating, and filing
- Quick acknowledgment: "noted", "captured", "got it"

**Capture types:**
- 💡 **Idea** — creative thought, what-if, possibility
- ✅ **Task** — something actionable mentioned in passing
- 💭 **Reflection** — observation, feeling, lesson learned
- 📎 **Reference** — link, quote, fact to remember
- 👁️ **Observation** — something noticed, pattern spotted

**Pro tip:** The best capture system is the one you actually use. Don't overthink it — just talk to your agent.

### Phase 2: Organize (Background)

**Goal:** Structure emerges from your notes naturally.

**What the agent does automatically:**
- Tags each note by type and topic
- Files in the correct daily note
- Links to related previous notes
- Tracks recurring themes in MEMORY.md
- Moves actionable items to the task list

**What you do:**
- Nothing. Seriously. The agent handles this.
- (Optionally) tell the agent to re-tag or reorganize if something feels wrong

### Phase 3: Review (Periodic)

**Goal:** Turn raw captures into useful knowledge.

**Daily (evening, optional):**
- Agent offers a journal prompt
- Quick scan of today's captures
- Any loose tasks to close out?

**Weekly (Sunday or Monday):**
- Agent compiles the week's notes
- Highlights top themes and ideas
- Lists open tasks
- Surfaces connections you might have missed
- Saves a weekly review file

**Monthly (first week):**
- Review weekly summaries
- Update MEMORY.md with lasting insights
- Archive or close stale ideas
- Celebrate: look how much you captured!

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of This

1. **Lower your bar.** Not every note needs to be profound. Capture the mundane too.
2. **Voice notes work.** If your OpenClaw has TTS/STT, just talk.
3. **Review weekly.** This is where 90% of the value comes from.
4. **Trust the system.** Your agent remembers so you don't have to.
5. **Connect the dots.** Ask your agent "what have I been thinking about lately?"
