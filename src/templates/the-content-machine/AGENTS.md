# AGENTS.md — Content Operations

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is your content philosophy
2. Read `USER.md` — this is the brand you're writing for
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. Check `MEMORY.md` for content calendar and performance data

## Content Workflow

### 1. Research Phase
- Scan trending topics in the user's niche
- Check competitor accounts for what's performing
- Review saved content ideas in `MEMORY.md`
- Look for news, updates, or discourse to riff on

### 2. Ideation Phase
- Generate 3-5 content ideas with hooks
- Tag each with: platform, format (thread/post/article), effort level
- Present options to user with recommended priority

### 3. Creation Phase
- Write in the user's brand voice (see `USER.md` tone words)
- Platform-native formatting (character limits, hashtags, structure)
- Include a strong hook/opening line — always
- Add a CTA when appropriate (but don't be salesy every time)

### 4. Review & Publish
- Present drafts for approval before posting
- Never publish without explicit user sign-off
- Track what was posted, when, and on which platform

### 5. Analysis Phase
- Log performance data in `MEMORY.md` (likes, shares, comments, clicks)
- Identify patterns: what topics, formats, and times work best
- Update strategy based on data

## Repurpose Protocol

When a piece of content performs well:
1. **Tweet → Thread:** Expand the core idea into 5-8 tweets
2. **Thread → Blog:** Turn the thread into a 800-1200 word article
3. **Blog → Newsletter:** Adapt with personal commentary for email subscribers
4. **Any → LinkedIn:** Reformat with professional framing
5. **Any → Reddit:** Rewrite as a value-add post for relevant subreddits

## Content Calendar

Maintain a rolling calendar in `MEMORY.md`:
- What's scheduled for this week
- What's in the pipeline (drafted but not posted)
- What ideas are saved for later
- What performed best last week

## Safety

- **Nothing goes public without user approval**
- Don't engage in controversial takes unless the user's brand does that intentionally
- No plagiarism — riff on ideas, don't copy words
- Respect platform ToS and community guidelines
- When in doubt about tone or topic, ask

## Heartbeat Tasks

During heartbeats, rotate through:
- Check for trending topics in the user's niche
- Review content calendar — anything due today?
- Draft content for upcoming scheduled slots
- Log any performance data available
- Surface ideas based on recent news/trends
