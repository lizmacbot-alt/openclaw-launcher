# CONTENT-SYSTEM.md — The Full Pipeline

## The Content Machine Framework

### Phase 1: Listen & Research (Daily)

**Goal:** Never run out of ideas.

- Monitor 3-5 sources in your niche daily (subreddits, Twitter lists, newsletters)
- Save interesting angles, hot takes, and questions people are asking
- Track what competitors are posting and what's getting engagement
- Keep a running list of "content seeds" — one-liner ideas to develop later

### Phase 2: Ideate & Plan (Weekly)

**Goal:** Fill next week's content calendar.

Every week, review your idea backlog and:
1. Pick 5-10 ideas that align with your content pillars
2. Assign each to a platform and format
3. Prioritize by: timeliness > audience demand > strategic value
4. Schedule in the content calendar

**Content Mix (recommended):**
- 40% educational (how-tos, tips, frameworks)
- 25% storytelling (personal experiences, behind-the-scenes)
- 20% engagement (questions, polls, hot takes)
- 15% promotional (product mentions, CTAs, launches)

### Phase 3: Create (Daily)

**Goal:** Produce platform-native content efficiently.

**The Hook Formula:**
- Start with a bold claim, surprising stat, or relatable problem
- First line = the only line that matters for reach
- Test multiple hooks for important pieces

**Platform-Specific Rules:**

**Twitter/X:**
- 1 idea per tweet. Clarity > cleverness.
- Threads: open with the strongest hook, close with a CTA
- Use line breaks for readability
- No hashtags in threads (they look spammy)

**LinkedIn:**
- Open with a hook, then hit Enter twice (the "see more" fold is everything)
- Personal stories outperform generic advice
- End with a question to drive comments
- 1-2 relevant hashtags max

**Reddit:**
- Lead with value. Self-promotion = instant downvotes.
- Write like a community member, not a marketer
- Long-form, detailed posts perform best
- Engage in comments — that's where the real reach is

**Blog/Newsletter:**
- Strong headline + compelling opening paragraph
- Use subheadings every 200-300 words
- Include actionable takeaways
- End with a clear next step for the reader

### Phase 4: Distribute (Daily)

**Goal:** Maximum reach from every piece of content.

**Same-Day Distribution:**
1. Post to primary platform
2. Engage with early comments (first 30-60 min matters most)
3. Cross-post adapted version to secondary platform

**Repurpose Waterfall (next 7 days):**
- Day 1: Original post
- Day 2-3: Adapted version for other platforms
- Day 4-5: Pull quotes or key takeaways as standalone posts
- Day 6-7: Compile related posts into a longer piece

### Phase 5: Analyze & Optimize (Weekly)

**Goal:** Do more of what works, less of what doesn't.

**Track per post:**
- Impressions/reach
- Engagement (likes, comments, shares, saves)
- Engagement rate (engagement / impressions)
- Click-throughs (if applicable)
- Follower growth attributed

**Weekly Review Questions:**
1. What was the #1 performing post? Why?
2. What flopped? Why?
3. Which content pillar drove the most engagement?
4. What time/day performed best?
5. What should I do more of next week?
