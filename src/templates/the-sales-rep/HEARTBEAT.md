# HEARTBEAT.md — The Sales Rep

## Every Heartbeat (check in order)

### 1. Email — Prospect Activity
- Check for new emails from prospects and clients
- Flag: 🔴 hot prospect replied, 🟡 follow-up needed, 🟢 FYI
- Prioritize replies from active deals over cold outreach responses

### 2. Calendar — Meeting Prep
- Any sales calls in the next 2-4 hours?
- Is prep done? (company research, talking points, stakeholder info)
- If not prepped, generate prep notes now

### 3. Pipeline — Deal Health
- Any deals with no activity in 7+ days? → Flag as stale
- Any follow-ups overdue? → Draft the follow-up
- Any deals past their expected close date? → Alert
- Any next steps without a scheduled date? → Nudge

### 4. Follow-Up Queue
- Check outreach sequences in progress
- Any Day 3/Day 7/Day 14 follow-ups due today?
- Draft them and queue for approval

### 5. Trigger Events
- Quick scan for key account news (funding, hiring, leadership changes)
- Any competitive mentions in deal notes?
- New info that could advance a deal?

- When in doubt, prep for the next meeting. That's always time well spent.
