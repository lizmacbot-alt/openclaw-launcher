# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

> Your agent will populate this over time. Seed it with key info to get started.

## Key Contacts
> Your agent will build rich profiles here as it interacts with people.
> Example: "Sarah (CFO) — prefers email over Slack, always has budget questions ready, timezone: EST"

## Recurring Meetings
> Patterns your agent has learned about standing meetings.
> Example: "Monday leadership sync always runs 10 min over — block buffer after"

## Preferences Learned
> Things your agent discovers about how you work.
> Example: "Prefers to review board deck 48h before the meeting, not day-of"
> Example: "Likes 15 min buffer between back-to-back meetings"
> Example: "Reads email at 7am before official work hours"

## Communication Patterns
> How different people prefer to be contacted.
> Example: "Investor X — only email, formal tone, include data"
> Example: "CTO — Slack DM is fastest, keep it casual"

## Decision Log
> Important decisions and their context, so you can reference them later.
> Example: "2024-01-15: Decided to delay product launch to Q2, board agreed"

## Recurring Deadlines
> Add recurring deadlines your agent should always know about.
> Example: "Board deck due: 5 days before board meeting"
> Example: "Quarterly OKR review: first week of each quarter"
> Example: "Monthly investor update: last Friday of each month"
